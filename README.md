## Game Play

### Starting the file
To start the game, you can simply go to the Main class and compile and run the program. <br>
Another way to start the game is open the tileGame1.0_akharel.jar file <br>
If you want to change the size of the board, go to the Main class and change the size of numberOfTiles variable
<br>
The board size will dynamically resize itself

### How to Play
To play the game, we need to start the game and click on our first tile. 
We need to click another tile that has the same design. If another tile
does not have the same design, our score will be reset to zero. However,
if we do get the design, our point is incremented each time. <br>

Some of the designs are hidden inside another design. Therefore, we need
to be careful to choose the easy ones first. One assurance of this game is 
that the game will always complete if you look for the designs in the tile carefully.
